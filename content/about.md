![My bio picture](/img/my-bio.png)


My name is Ji Huang. I am a PhD student in [Dr. Karen McGinnis][1] lab at Florida State University. We use maize as our model organism to study gene regulation, especially epigenetic regulation. I'm interested in how genes and TEs are regulated at genome-wide scale. I become more and more interesed in gene regulation by transcriptional factors (TFs) recently. Before joining FSU, I got my Bachelor degree in biological science from [Huazhong Agricultural University][5], China.
