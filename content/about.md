My name is Ji Huang. I'm a post-doc at [Gloria Coruzzi lab][7] at NYU. I did my PhD in [Dr. Karen McGinnis][1] lab at Florida State University. I'm interested in how genes are regulated by transcriptional factors (TFs) in the network. I got my Bachelor degree in biological science from [Huazhong Agricultural University][5], China.

You can view my CV here. [Get the PDF](/Ji_Huang_CV_201711.pdf).
